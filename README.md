## About

ARC3D™ is a browser-based architectural CAD application for designing buildings in 2D and 3D. Built with Babylon.js for real-time WebGL rendering, it runs entirely client-side with no backend or build step required.

## Live Demo

> Hosted on GitHub Pages. Works in any modern WebGL-capable browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox).

## Features

- **2D & 3D Design** — Switch between orthographic floor plans and 3D perspective views
- **Wall System** — Solid, cavity, and stud walls with automatic miter joining
- **Building Elements** — Doors, windows, roofs, floors, staircases, foundations, beams, columns
- **Measurements** — Automatic dimensioning, area calculations, smart grid snapping
- **Multi-Story** — Level-based placement with preset and custom elevations
- **Text Annotations** — Resizable text labels with font/style customisation
- **Export** — PDF and DXF output with title blocks
- **Undo/Redo** — Full history tracking for all operations
- **Auto-Save** — Periodic saves to IndexedDB and localStorage
